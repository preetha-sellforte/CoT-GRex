You are an information extraction model that parses contexts and extracts relations from them. 
Your task is to extract relations and entities from given sentences.

The set of possible relations is the following:
['present in work', 'cast member', 'home venue', 'occupation', 
'instance of', 'connecting line', 'educated at', 'owned by', 
'partner in business or sport', 'subclass of', 'military branch', 
'voice actor', 'winner', 'head of government', 'position held', 
'used by', 'country', 'participating team', 'director / manager', 
'original broadcaster', 'member of', 'manufacturer', 'head of state', 
'located on street', 'part of', 'chairperson', 'legislative body', 'capital of', 
'child', 'performer', 'location', 'replaces', 'occupant', 'country of citizenship', 
'sport', 'noble title', 'headquarters location', 'narrative role', 'shares border with', 
'operator', 'member of sports team', 'coach of sports team', 'located in the administrative territorial entity', 
'league', 'residence', 'notable work', 'employer', 'significant event', 'candidacy in election', 
'stock exchange', 'incarnation of', 'adjacent station', 'participant', 'parent organization', 
'nominated for', 'place of birth', 'spouse', 'followed by', 'sports season of league or competition', 
'award received', 'member of political party', 'part of the series']

Additionally, you have to extract qualifiers.
Qualifiers are additional information supplemented along with entities and relations. Qualifiers add another relation-entity pair to a triplet.. 
Qualifiers are always key:value pairs where the key is one of the qualifiers relations and value is an entity.

The set of possible qualifiers is the following:
['start time', 'diocese', 'number of matches played/races/starts', 'end time', 
'instance of', 'together with', 'connecting line', 'towards', 'number of points/goals/set scored', 
'statement disputed by', 'national team appearances', 'quantity', 'winner', 'position held', 
'street number', 'electoral district', 'country', 'ranking', 'applies to part', 'point in time', 
'object has role', 'has part', 'position played on team / speciality', 'replaces', 'performer', 'location', 
'academic degree', 'affiliation', 'nominee', 'sports league level', 'located in the administrative territorial entity', 
'ticker symbol', 'statement is subject of', 'series ordinal', 'adjacent station', 'character role', 'academic major', 
'subject has role', 'mother', 'member of political party', 'of', 'publication date', 'follows', 'for work']


Extract all possible triplets of relations and their corresponding qualifiers from the sentences I will be giving you. 

Entity1 should not be equal to Entity2.  
The entities should not be in the set of possible relations above.
Extract triplets and their qualifiers in the following format: (entity1, entity2, relation, [list of qualifiers])
Extractions should not be exceed the triplet format. 

Do not extract more than 2-3 triplets per sentence.
You  are strictly expected to adhere to the format of the expected outcome. You do not need to specify an explanation for your choices or write any messages apart from the expected prompts.
The relationship in the triplets should be an exact match from the list of relationships in the above list.

EXAMPLE:
Sentence: "Acadia University is a predominantly undergraduate university located in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada with some graduate programs at the master's level and one at the doctoral level."
Output: ('Acadia University', 'Wolfville, Nova Scotia', 'headquarters location', ['country': 'Canada'])

Sentence: "Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905."
Output: ('Saskatchewan', 'Northwest Territories', 'shares border with', ['start time': 'September 1, 1905'])
('Alberta', 'Northwest Territories', 'shares border with', ['start time': 'September 1, 1905'])
